# Additionally-Modified-Round-Robin-Algorithm
------> Abstract

Multiprogramming is a process or method of executing multiple processes simultaneously in the
memory. Its primary aim is to minimize the average waiting time, average turnaround time and
maximize the CPU utilization. There are various CPU scheduling algorithms are used to
performed multiprogramming like First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF),
Priority Scheduling (PS) and Round Robin (RR).
This project deals with the simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms with C.
The following algorithms are simulated:

• First Come First Serve (FCFS)

• Shortest Job First

• SRTF Algorithm

• Round Robin

• Our innovative algorithm

The metrics such as waiting time and turnaround time taken for the processes to complete,
number of rounds, etc are calculated.

The target of this project is to also propose a new CPU scheduling algorithm which will perform
superior than current round robin algorithm and in most cases better than other algorithms as well
in terms of minimizing average waiting time, average turnaround time and number of context
switches.

----->Introduction



In a lone processor system, processor can run only a solitary methodology at some random
minute and diverse techniques need to hold up until the point that the moment that the CPU is
free and these strategies can be rescheduled yet again.

The objective of multiprogramming is to run numerous process at once and to open up the
employments of CPU. Planning is a central working framework work. In multiprogramming
figuring frameworks, wastefulness is frequently caused by ill-advised utilization of CPU. In
multiprogramming frameworks, various procedures are being kept in memory for most extreme
usage of CPU use can be opened up by exchanging CPU among holding up procedures in the
memory and running some procedure constantly. Which process ought to be chosen next for
administration, is a critical inquiry, since it influences the adequacy of the administration. it
impacts the practicality of the organization. The crucial point of the CPU planning calculations is
to boosting CPU usage and throughput and limiting turnaround time, holding up time, reaction
time and number of settings exchanging for an arrangement of solicitations.

CPU scheduling algorithm are utilized to dispense the CPU to the procedures holding up in the
prepared line. A portion of the famous CPU booking calculations are First-Come-First-Served
(FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling and Round Robin (RR).
